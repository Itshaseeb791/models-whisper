🎙️ Whisper Local Audio Transcriber

A simple, production-style Python command line application that converts audio files into text using the open-source OpenAI Whisper speech recognition model, running completely locally.

This tool allows you to transcribe audio files such as MP3, M4A, WAV, and FLAC directly from the terminal without requiring any external API or internet connection after the model is downloaded.

📦 Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Itshaseeb791/models-whisper
cd whisper-transcriber
2️⃣ Install Python Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Install FFmpeg

Whisper requires FFmpeg to process audio files.

Windows

Download from:

https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

Extract and add the bin folder to your System PATH.

Verify installation:

ffmpeg -version
▶️ Usage

Basic command:

python transcribe.py audio_file.m4a

Transcribe multiple files:

python transcribe.py audio1.mp3 audio2.m4a

Select a specific Whisper model:

python transcribe.py audio1.mp3 audio2.mp3 --model small
💻 Example Output
INFO: Loading Whisper model: base
INFO: Model loaded successfully.
INFO: Transcribing: test.m4a

⚙️ How It Works

The program loads a Whisper speech recognition model.

If the model is not present locally, it is automatically downloaded.

The audio file is processed using FFmpeg.

Whisper converts speech into text.

The transcription is printed to the terminal.

After the first run, the model is cached locally and no internet connection is required.
